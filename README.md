In the context of Internet of Things (IoT - Internet of Things), more and more devices are connected to each other and to the Internet, so that their integrated journeys can deliver value to people, making devices and environments more intelligent.

The dematerialization of the mobile application, integration with natural language interfaces and data collection for personalization of services are some examples of what the IoT can offer.
However, for these value proposals to be made tangible, some challenges must be overcome:

* Complexity: how to integrate so many interfaces, services and devices?
* How to tolerate connection failures, to maintain a service level compatible with the current solution?
* How to deal with physical power, bandwidth and processing limitations?
* How to speed up the development of control and monitoring of power modules, for software developers?

To address these challenges, the Hedwig accelerator kit was developed, as a way to accelerate development by encapsulating aspects of communication infrastructure obtained from the HedwigÂ¹ Project, from USP's Polytechnic School.

As differentials, we focus on dematerialization (integration with voice interface and other external applications) and non-functional requirements (tolerance to communication failures and usability).
integration with power module (up to 3A), with serial protocol for integration with Arduino Nano, integrated with cloud and local APIs to accelerate application development. The module is ideal for transforming Arduino projects into IoT projects, and its use in conjunction with a project-oriented learning method is recommended.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
