# Ambient Intelligence

* Under **CPN folder**, ther is a synthetic data generator model built with CPN Tools. To run the model, you must have [CPN Tools](http://cpntools.org/) installed. The model mirrors an existing testbed in Brazil [see more details](https://github.com/vthayashi/OKIoT/tree/master/BrazilTestbed). Output files with synthetic data can be found under data folder.

* Parser python script, and random forest model are available in **Random Forest** folder. It was executed in a Python 2.7 Windows environment with deafult 32-bit Python setup.

* Data collected from [Brazilian testbed](https://github.com/vthayashi/OKIoT/tree/master/BrazilTestbed), open data from [CASAS Testbed](http://casas.wsu.edu/), and synthetic data from CPN model are available in **LSTM** folder, along with notebooks with experiments with LSTM models for event prediction in the smart home.

* LSTM prediction models were based on the ones found in [Coursera Sequences, Times Series and Prediction MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction#syllabus)
